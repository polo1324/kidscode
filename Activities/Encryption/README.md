# Encryption

### What is it
Physical demonstration of how public and private key encyption works. Two people attempt to agree on a shared secret colour while a third person attempts to steal it.
Inspiration - https://youtu.be/EDTx3meIeT0 

### Resources
- Colour / Food dye
- Clear containers 
- Water
- Robber mask (for the audience member pretending to be the criminal in the middle)

### Setup
 - 9 cups needed.
 - 3 cups per person
 - Mix 900ml of blue food coluring, pour 300ml into one of A, B, and C's cups.
 - This ensures everyone has the same shade of blue.
 - Cup of 450ml of red for person A, Cup of 450ml yellow for B.
 - Setup now complete.

### Steps

- Person A mixed 300ml of red with their blue (making 600ml purple).
- Person A passes to C, representing C intercepting the communication.
- C takes half of the purple (300ml)
- C passes to B, B keeps it and does nothing with it yet.
- B mixes 300ml of yellow with their blue (making green).
- B passes to C, C steals half in their other empty cup.
- C passes to A.
- Now for the trick!
- A mixes their remaining red with the green (150ml red 150ml blue 150ml yellow)!
- C mixes their remaining yellow with the purple (150ml red 150ml blue 150ml yellow)!
- By Jove! The colours match! Pause for 'oooohs' and thunderous applause from the audience.
- Now person B mixes their stolen green and purple together, but its a different colour! (because they have 300ml of blue instead of 150ml).
- Person B only has blue available to them, and adding that just makes it worse!

### Explanations 

- Although easy to mix, its very difficult (impossible even) to unmix colours.
- This is what we call a one-way function, easy in one direction but hard in the other.
- Another real example of a one-way function in real life is baking a cake, you can mix all the ingredients together and bake a cake, but reversing that to get the eggs back out is impossible.
- By mixing the public and private colours together, no one can work out your private colour (it stays private as it should)
- This is how computers communicate over the internet, and this is why you get your little padlock symbol next to the URL in your browser.
- Your computer and the website's computer agree on a secret number, or key just like we agreed on a secret colour.
